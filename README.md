# CoffeeOrders.xlsx
Used Microsoft Excel for this project.
Gather the data from three tables: orders, customers, and products
Use the XLOOKUP formula to gather customer data (name, email, country)
Use the INDEX/MATCH formula to gather product data (coffee type, roast type, unit price, profit)
Clean the data by removing duplicates and formatting the tables as Excel tables
Create pivot tables to summarize the data by country, customer, and coffee type
Create charts from the pivot tables
Copy and paste the charts and slicers from other worksheets onto the dashboard worksheet
Use the Report Connections feature to link the slicers and timeline to all the charts
Format the dashboard to improve its visual appeal
Hide unnecessary elements like gridlines, formula bar, scrollbars, and sheet tabs
Made a dashboard consiting of all charts, slicers and timelines to make it readable to the "Public"
